STOP #11 Corner Olive and Lovell
In 1897, the reverend John Rea, a Congregational minister from Oakland, retired to Mill
Valley where he became a successful real estate broker and builder (he built the Keystone
block on Lytton Square and the Congregational Church on Summit Ave.). He founded the
Congregational Church and served as its first pastor.
