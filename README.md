## Building History

Built in 1906 by Reverend John Rae, the Keystone Building originally housed several churches (Methodist, Episcopal, Christian Science), shops, post office, and a gas and electric company.

In 1920 the Keystone Building housed multiple small shops. These included a drug store and a grocery store. It was considered to be in the center of town and was a common meeting place.  In about 1922, the building was purchased from John Raeâ€™s widow, Catherine P. Rea, by William Kent, Jr., Thos Kent, Thomas Minto, and W.H.R. Norstrand.
